# SCT_ML_3 - Cats vs Dogs Image Classification using SVM

## Overview
This project implements an **SVM classifier** to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Cats and Dogs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog)
- **Classes**: Cats, Dogs
- **Image Size**: Resized to 64x64 pixels

## Steps Performed
1. Downloaded dataset directly from Kaggle using API.
2. Converted images to grayscale and resized to 64x64 pixels.
3. Flattened images into feature vectors.
4. Trained an SVM classifier with a linear kernel.
5. Evaluated accuracy and generated classification report.

## Libraries Used
- numpy
- opencv-python
- scikit-learn
- tqdm

## Output
- Accuracy score
- Classification report
